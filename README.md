# MyReads Project

MyReads project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will be used to persist information as you interact with the application.

You can view books in your library in their different shelves on the main page and search for books based on the authors and titles.

This app is the first of two projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) core curriculum.
